Once upon a time, in a distant city, a young boy embarked on a journey to take an important exam. Arriving a day early, he searched for an affordable place to stay but found no luck. With limited funds, he turned to the gurudwara for shelter. Little did he know, this decision would lead to a series of unexpected events.

Amidst the chaos and conflicts within the gurudwara, the boy and his fellow shelter-seekers were abruptly expelled. With nowhere to go, they stumbled upon an abandoned rooftop, seeking solace in their shared predicament. Throughout the night, they found comfort in each other's company, sharing stories and offering support.

In a twist of fate, the boy discovered a dropped wallet containing a substantial amount of money. Overwhelmed with guilt, he chose to keep the secret to himself, witnessing the owner's distress. Struggling with his conscience, he resolved to make amends.

Despite the burden of guilt, the boy went on to take his exam, hoping to return home and find redemption. The journey back was filled with contemplation and reflection. He realized that the shame of admitting his mistake was far less significant than the weight of his actions.

Upon reaching home, the boy confessed his misdeed to his family, seeking forgiveness and vowing to make things right. Together, they decided to return the money anonymously, hoping to restore balance and rectify the past.

In the end, the boy's courage to confront his guilt and take responsibility brought about a transformative change within him. It was a lesson learned through a challenging yet enlightening adventure, reminding him of the importance of integrity and the power of redemption.
